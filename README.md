The error indicates an "Access Denied" issue when trying to install the pandasai package, likely due to insufficient permissions to modify files in the specified directory (E:\folder E\DS-projects\AI-HandsOn\HandsOn\venv\Lib\site-packages\...). This is common on Windows when the Python environment or the target directory requires elevated permissions. Hereâ€™s how to resolve it:

    - Check Folder Permissions:
        Navigate to E:\folder E\DS-projects\AI-HandsOn\HandsOn\venv\Lib\site-packages in File Explorer.
        Right-click the site-packages folder, select "Properties," then the "Security" tab.
        Ensure your user account (or the "Administrators" group) has "Full control" permissions.
        If not, click "Edit," grant "Full control" to your user or group, and apply changes.
        Retry the installation.
